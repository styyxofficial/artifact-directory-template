Title:
Using Latent Variable Models to Predict Mouse Behavior

Abstract:
Dimensionality reduction, typically applied to data in order to make it more usable and generally easier to model, is often used to understand neural spike data, which is typically very complex due to its high-dimensional nature. Through latent factor modeling, we can effectively apply dimensionality reduction to this data and create lower dimensional representations of it. With data compiled from the International Brain Lab, we applied a Variational Latent Gaussian Process model (vLGP) in order to extract latent trajectories from the data collected within the motor cortex. These trajectories are separated into four distinct categories, representing the activity from the designated brain region when the mouse moves the wheel in one direction correctly in response to the stimulus, or when the mouse moves the wheel in the incorrect direction. These trajectories reveal linear separability between the correct decisions in different directions (when the mouse turns the wheel clockwise correctly versus when the mouse turns the wheel counter-clockwise correctly). Comparing this model to Gaussian Process Factor Analysis (GPFA), another dimensionality reduction technique - reveals that vlGP produces cleaner and more interpretable trajectories while also being more scalable to larger amounts of data without running into memory issues.
